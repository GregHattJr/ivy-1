Ivy is a static website generator built in Python. It's small, elegant, and easy to use.

    $ ivy --help

    Usage: ivy [FLAGS] [COMMAND]

      Ivy is a static website generator. It transforms a
      directory of text files into a self-contained website.

    Flags:
      -h, --help          Print the application's help text.
      -v, --version       Print the application's version.

    Commands:
      build               Build the site.
      clear               Clear the output directory.
      init                Initialize a new site directory.
      serve               Run a server on the output directory.
      tree                Print the site's node tree.
      watch               Monitor the site directory and
                          automatically rebuild on changes.

    Command Help:
      help <command>      Print the command's help text.

Ivy is free and open source. You can find its source files on [Github](https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy).

You can build any kind of website using Ivy but it's particularly suited to building project documentation like the documentation you're looking at right now.



### Installation

Install Ivy from the Python Package Index using `pip`:

    $ pip install ivy

Ivy requires Python 3.6 or later.



### Buy it for life

Attention-seeking tools are an annoyance. I've built Ivy as a solid, simple tool that I can use without thinking about for the next twenty years.

Ivy is highly extensible so updates to its core will be few and far between. Maintaining backwards compatibility will always have a higher priority than adding new features.
