* Bug reports are welcome.

* Feature requests are welcome too, although I'll probably say no. My plan is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible.

* Ivy is a personal project, not a community project. As a general rule I won't accept unsolicited pull requests.

* If you do want to hack on Ivy, consider writing an extension or forking the repository and using it as the basis for your own personalized static site generator. Remember, all of Ivy's code has been placed in the public domain so you can do whatever you want with it, no attribution required.
